This is a App just like tinder app we use in our mobiles(except location attribute) made using python and MySQL.

1.We can Sign Up giving the basic Credentials required.
2.After Login we can see the members (that are in database)
3.we can send a proposal request to any of the members.
4. 1 member cannot be proposed twice.
5.we can view the number of proposals sent from our account as well as recieved to our account.
6.If i propose X and X also has previously proposed me then thats a MATCH! which will be shown.
